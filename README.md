# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

### Setting Up
* The  **html** and **Javascript** files are the main files used to run analysis.

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

1. **Data set**

   The Json representation of data was obtained from the USGS website.  The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats:  [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).   

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   * Leaflet was used to create a map that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes have different sizes and colors based on magnitudes and depthes.

   * Popups are included to provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * A legend has been added to provide context for the map data.

### Level 2: More Data (Optional)

* Plotted a second second data set on to illustrate illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity using the link:  <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

* Added a number of base maps as well as separate  overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Added layer controls/buttons to the map.
